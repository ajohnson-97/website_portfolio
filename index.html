            Welcome to my website
            <br><br>
            My name is Anthony Johnson. I am a first year student at Sheridan College, taking "Network Engineering Technology". 
            In addition to school, I do a lot to advance my education and gain experience outside of class.
            I like to spend my time learning new things by reading books and taking extra-curricular classes through online schools like the Cisco Networking Academy; 
            <a href="https://www.netacad.com/" target="_blank">"Netacad"</a>
            I have gotten numerous industry certifications from my extra-curricular learning and I'm always preparing for the next certification exam to take my career to the next level.
